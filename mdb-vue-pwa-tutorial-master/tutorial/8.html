      <strong>PWA audit</strong>
    </h2>

    <p>How can we tell if our app is working as a progressive web app? Is there something we can improve on? Or our app
      is already good enough?</p>

    <p>In today's article, we are going to learn about an auditing tool which helps us determine if our app qualifies as
      a PWA.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-5"><strong>Lighthouse</strong> </h4>

    <p>Lighthouse is an open source tool introduced by Google. At first, it was created to measure the performance of
      PWA, but now its functionality covers much more. It verifies the quality of your application in five categories:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Performance</li>
      <li>Progressive Web App</li>
      <li>Accessibility</li>
      <li>Best Practices</li>
      <li>SEO</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the report, you will get a score between 0 and 100 points, where 100 is the highest. Your score may vary
      between tests - it may happen because of changing network conditions, different processes running in the
      background on your computer and so forth. It is worth to run a few tests and take the average of the results. </p>

    <p>Moreover, the report gives you a set of recommendations - that, when implemented, improve your website
      performance and visibilitzy to the search engines. It's always a good idea to measure your site against Google's
      set of criteria - the suggestions help one to become a better developer.</p>

    <p>Lighthouse is available as a Chrome extension for Chrome 52 and later, and since lately, Firefox, too!</p>

    <h4 class="mt-5"><strong>How to run the audit?</strong> </h4>

    <p>To run the audit open your app in a browser (Chromium / Chrome / Firefox). Auditing tools can be found in the
      Audits tab.</p>

    <div class="text-center"> <img class="img-fluid"
        src="https://mdbootstrap.com/wp-content/themes/mdbootstrap4/content/react/tutorials/react-pwa/8/audit.png"
        alt="Lighthouse audit"></div>

    <p>Open the tab, adjust the settings to your needs or run as a default. After a brief moment, you will see the
      report.</p>

    <div class="text-center"> <img class="img-fluid"
        src="https://mdbootstrap.com/wp-content/themes/mdbootstrap4/content/react/tutorials/react-pwa/8/lighthouse.png"
        alt="Lighthouse report"></div>

    <p>As you can see, there is some room for improvement! By clicking on categories or by scrolling down, we can
      examine the test results in detail.</p>

    <div class="text-center"> <img class="img-fluid"
        src="https://mdbootstrap.com/wp-content/themes/mdbootstrap4/content/react/tutorials/vue-pwa/8/details.png"
        alt="detailed PWA report"></div>

    <p>There are at least few things we could do to make our app more Progressive. Let's start from the bottom.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-5"><strong><code>Content is not sized correctly to the viewport</strong></h4>

    <p>The issue is that at some point, while Lighthouse has been checking how does our app behave on different viewport
      widths, the <code>innerWidth</code> and <code>outerWidth</code> properties of the <code>window</code> interface
      have been different. To ensure the best mobile user experience, the test is effectively checking whether the
      content does not overflow horizontally, leading to an unexpected scroll time. The number of pixels in the hint
      indicates at what width the problem appears - by narrowing the browser window, you can simulate it to see
      the problem from up close.</p>

    <div class="text-center"> <img class="img-fluid"
        src="https://mdbootstrap.com/wp-content/themes/mdbootstrap4/content/react/tutorials/vue-pwa/8/width.png"
        alt="Content is leaking to the right"></div>

    <p>The culprit is right there - when the horizontal space is getting scarce, the two main columns of our app stay
      side by side, resulting in the text being pushed out the right border. How to solve it? Well, for one, we could
      add a scoped <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag to our <code>./src/App.vue</code> file and include there a CSS
      <code>overflow-x: hidden;</code> rule targetting the main <code>.container</code>.</p>

    <p>The solution would allow us to pass the test by hiding away the problem's effects, but let's face it - it would
      not allow us to regain what we're currently loosing, namely the control over the flow of the content on narrow
      viewports. We are good devs with genuine intent, so let's utilize the MDB customizability instead. After all, why
      hide the leaking content, if we could have it beautifully displayed using the library?</p>

    <p>Let's have the layout as it is, but with a minor detail change - in case there is no space to have the main
      columns side-by-side, may the content flow down. We'll achieve it using the <a
        href="https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/vue/layout/grid-usage/">MDBVue's grid system</a> through
      <code>&lt;mdb-col&gt;</code> props.</p>

    <p>The way it is now, we are describing the columns' widths as <code>9</code> and <code>3</code> for all the screen
      sizes. As we know from <a href="https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/vue/layout/grid-usage/">the docs</a>, though, that we
      can overwrite these using dedicated props for given sizes and up.</p>

    <p>Ideally, we would like to keep the current columns' proportion for all the screen sizes wider than
      <code>sm</code>(all), where the columns should go one beneath the other, taking up all the available horizontal
      space, which, in case of our grid, means full <code>12</code>.</p>

    <p>To achieve it, identify the two root columns in the app. We must fiddle with their props - assign maximum width
      for default (the smallest) screens, and overwrite it with the current proportions for all the viewport widths
      beyond smartphone ones using the <code>sm</code> prop.</p>

    <mdbsnippet>
      <code data-lang="html" data-name="./src/App.vue">
        <template>
          <mdb-container>
            <Notification :status="status" />
            <mdb-row>
              <mdb-col col="12" sm="9">
                <!-- first column's contents... -->
              </mdb-col>
              <mdb-col col="12" sm="3">
                <!-- second column's contents... -->
              </mdb-col>

      </code>
    </mdbsnippet>

    <p>Try it out now - the content should gracefully flow down on mobile, while the Lighthouse PWA width test should
      pass as well!</p>

    <h4 class="mt-5"><strong><code>Does not set a theme color for the address bar</strong></h4>

    <p>Lighthouse audit considers the lack of the <code>theme-color</code> meta tag a failure. But didn't we declare it
      at the very end of our <code>manifest.json</code> (although spelled with an underscore, <code>theme_color</code>)?
    </p>

    <p>It turns out we should always specify the color using the tag. Browsers do acknowledge the manifest, but only
      once the user has added the page to their home screen. Otherwise, the tag overwrites the value from the manifest,
      allowing for a bit more customization (to have different theme color for different subpages). Let's add the tag,
      then!</p>

    <mdbsnippet>
      <code data-lang="html" data-name="./index.html">
        <!--...somewhere in the head tag... -->
        <meta name="theme-color" content="#4DBA87">
      </code>
    </mdbsnippet>

    <p>Yup, it is all there is to it!</p>

    <h4 class="mt-5"><strong><code>Does not redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS</strong></h4>

    <p>We want to have communication to be secure(r) with <code>https</code> - and we want it with no exceptions. In
      practice it means configuring the server to redirect all the <code>http</code> traffic back to safety. For our
      development environment we could use <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware">
        <code>webpack-dev-middleware</code></a> to add a little middleware listening to requests starting with
      <code>http</code> or with the <code>request.secure</code> flag being set to <code>false</code> and then
      redirecting to the same place, only over the <code>https</code>.</p>

    <p>The effort would guarantee passing of the test, but we'd miss the bigger picture. The test is about the way our
      server is handling insecure requests from our users, and us bending our development environment for particular
      redirects would not change anything for them. If we really want to ensure safety and privacy for our audience through
      <code>https</code>, it is the <code>production server</code> we should worry about. In general, exact ways to
      fulfill the requirement depend on the server architecture and configuration.</p>

    <p>We're in luck - many platforms for hosting our project, like <code>Firebase</code> or <code>GitHub Pages</code>,
      are secure by default - their servers redirect traffic from <code>http</code> to <code>https</code>
      out-of-the-box. Deploy the project, head to the given URL and run the audit again to see what I mean.</p>

    <p><code>yarn deploy</code></p>

    <p>If you are looking at the production build audit, you may recognize the redirects test passes - and many other
      followed. Our results got boosted up across the board!</p>

    <div class="text-center"> <img class="img-fluid"
        src="https://mdbootstrap.com/wp-content/themes/mdbootstrap4/content/react/tutorials/vue-pwa/8/prod-details.png"
        alt="PWA report on Firebase"></div>

    <h4 class="mt-5"><strong><code>Page load is not fast enough on mobile networks</code></strong></h4>

    <p>This here is another issue that got solved by building our project. Why? By building we mean undertaking
      optimizarions not possible nor desired for development. Our webpack production setup <code>uglifies</code> the
      code (meaning both minifying and obscuring it), strips it of the comments, whitespaces (and quotation marks for
      HTML attributes), splits the JavaScript into chunks, and compresses media - be sure to check out
      <code>./build/webpack.prod.conf.js</code> file for the details!</p>

    <p>All that adds up to the app's much better performance, bolstered up with the extra fast Firebase CDN. With hard
      work and some infrastucture help, we made our app fully progressive!</p>

    <p>Question of performance, though, should be never taken lightly! It is always worth exploring, whether we could
      have our app deliver content even faster - after all, it would constitute the experience that would have people
      return. Enhance the caching policy to include necessary resources and experiment with preloading and deffering
      scripts using the <code>defer</code> attribute to speed up the load times.</p>

    <p>As we've learnt in the article, Lighthouse Audit is a powerful benchmarking tool aimed to provide guildelines for
      mobile - first web developers. It certainly helps to get our apps straight in terms of PWA support and
      performance, but don't aim to satisfy the only the test itself - oftentimes, it's the test's wider context what is worth
      considering. All in all, considering these guidelines is a great way to learn best practices.</p>
