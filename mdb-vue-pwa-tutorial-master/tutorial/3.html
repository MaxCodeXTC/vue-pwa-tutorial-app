      <strong>Making an app installable I: The Manifest</strong>
    </h2>

    <p class="description">
      One of the most powerful functions that PWA offers is the ability to add our web app to a device's home screen.
      This feature helps to bridge the gap between native and web apps, allowing for the latter to look and feel the
      "native" way.
    </p>

    <p class="description">Surprisingly, <strong>it doesn't require a lot of work</strong>. We will cover everything in
      the upcoming lessons.</p>

    <p class="description">What the feature boils down to is presenting users with ability to install our
      app onto their homescreens. In pratice, the ability takes form of an App Install Banner - a simple browser dialog.
      According to <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners/">the official
        documentation</a>, there
      are only few requirements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The web app is not already installed</li>
      <li>the user has interacted with the domain for at least 30 seconds</li>
      <li>codebase includes a web app <code>manifest</code></li>
      <li>App is served over HTTPS</li>
      <li>Has registered a service worker with a fetch event handler (currently necessary for Chrome on Android only)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Of course the two first ones are beyond our control, it's the user who decides for how long the interactions
      takes place or what is or isn't installed at their homescreens. As developers, we have to take care of the last
      three. Let's begin with the app manifest.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-5"><strong>What is an app manifest?</strong></h3>

    <p>App manifest is a simple JSON file, describing some of the properties the app has to have defined to utilize the
      PWA charm. In that, the file resembles an App Store description of a native app. It is possible that you have
      already stumbled upon it in some other projects' directories, escpecially the ones created using
      <code>vue-cli</code> or <code>create-react-app</code> boilerplate systems.</p>

    <p>Minimal <code>manifest.json</code> consists of these fields:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>name</code> and <code>short_name</code> - either one. If both are provided, <code>short_name</code> is
        used on the user's home screen, launcher, or other places where space may be limited. <code>name</code> is used
        in the app install prompt.</li>
      <li><code>icons</code> - an array of objects represening images, each with its <code>src</code>, <code>size</code>
        and <code>type</code> fields. Must include 192px and 512px sized icons. Chrome will automatically scale the icon
        for the device. If you'd prefer to scale your own icons and adjust them for pixel-perfection, provide icons in
        increments of 48dp</li>
      <li><code>start_url</code> - tells the browser where your application should start when it is launched, and
        prevents the app from starting on whatever page the user was on when they added your app to their home screen.
        Add a query string to the end of the start_url to track how often your installed app is launched</li>
      <mdbsnippet>
        <code data-lang="js" data-name="public/manifest.json">
          "start_url": "/?utm_source=homescreen",
        </code>
      </mdbsnippet>
      <li><code>display</code></li> must be one of: <code>fullscreen</code>, <code>standalone</code>, or
      <code>minimal-ui</code>. It changes how much of browser UI is shown to the user and can range from "browser" (when
      the full browser window is shown) to "fullscreen" (when the app is full-screened).
    </ul>

    <p>A full list of the supported properties which can be used is found <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest">here</a>.</p>

    <p>
      Now, armed with the necessary theoretical background, let's create a <code>manifest.json</code> file on our own!
      Let's place it in the project's <code>/static</code> directory, hinting that we want to keep it as it is (static),
      rather than having it somehow processed, as we do with the <code>.vue</code> files, for example. Doing so in there
      means we no longer need the <code>.gitkeep</code> file, which was only ensuring the folder gets considered by the
      contol system we can freely get rid of it.
    </p>

      <code data-lang="js" data-name="static/manifest.json">

    <h3 class="title mb-4">Icons</h3>

    <p>
      As you can see, the JSON file are referencing a number of images of different sizes we do not have yet. Why do we
      even include them all? There is a world of screens waiting for our PWA to get installed, most of them have their
      own size and pixel density. To be able to cover that means preparing these images up front and including them into
      our web manifest. Let the app do the rest regarding picking a proper picture for viewing.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote bq-danger my-2">
      <p class="bq-title">Note!</p>
      <p>All the different sizes are mentioned to illustrate the possible pixel-perfect coverage purposes, which
        exceed beyond a minimal manifest example. To satisfy Lighthouse PWA Audit, which is an important benchmark
        (more on that in the upcoming lesson) you may want to start off small. In that case, I'd suggest beginning with
        a 192x192px and a 512x512px-sized icons.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Let's break the list down. The <code>36x36</code>, <code>48x48</code>, <code>72x72</code>, <code>96x96</code>,
      <code>144x144</code> and <code>192x192</code> pixels icons are optimized to be used on the Android platform; folks
      at Google made sure these sizes would play well without getting pixelated or blurry. To cover all the Andoroid
      needs, what we also need is a <code>512x512</code> - it's used for the splash-screens.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sizes of icons for iOS platform are: <code>120x120</code>, <code>152x152</code>, <code>167x167</code> and
      <code>180x180</code> pixels. It's the last one that covers the most current iOS guidelines - the others are
      included for backward compatibility reasons. The final dimensions set you might need, <code>1024x1024</code>, is
      used in the Apple App Store. Even though not many PWAs end up there, a large square icon might turn out handy, as
      it can always get scaled down by the plarform.
    </p>

    <p>
      You'd like to have your own icon, but you do not know where to start? When it comes to the very design, the same
      best practices for <a href="https://material.io/design/iconography/#icon-treatments">any Android icon</a> should
      be followed. In case you already have an icon for an app, but you think creating all these different files
      manually is a drag - you are absolutely right! There are many online tools for creating necessary icon sets for
      PWA - you may want to <a href="http://letmegooglethat.com/?q=pwa+icon+generator">research</a> your favorite one,
      or let us provide you with a <a href="TODO">zip</a> so you don't have to. Add the (unzipped) <code>/icons </code>
      folder into the <code>static/</code> directory.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-5"><strong>Linking the manifest up</strong></h3>

    <p>We are almost done here - the only thing that's left is actually letting the browser know the manifest is on
      board by including it into the <code>&gt;head&lt;</code> tag of our <Code>./index.html</Code> file in the
      project's root directory.</p>

    <mdbsnippet>
      <code data-lang="html" data-name="./index.html">

        <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          ...
          <link rel="manifest" href="/static/manifest.json" />
        </head>
      </code>
    </mdbsnippet>

    <p>
      After running <code>yarn build</code> or <code>yarn deploy</code>, you should see the <code>/static</code> folder
      copy being instilled <strong>inside</strong> the <code>/dist</code> directory. Having the file structure copied
      means the relative route, embedded explicitly in our HTML, stays the same, while the rest of the project gets
      prepared for a deploy.
    </p>

    <p>
      To see whether everything works, simply <code>yarn dev</code> the project and refer to the devtools console
      (<code>F12</code> or <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Shift</code> + <code>J</code> depending on the browser used). All
      the possible problems with icon availability, caused by either a file mis-naming or improper JSON formatting
      should be listed there. For more holistic approach towards testing the PWA-readiness of our app, stick with us for
      an upcoming lesson regarding the audit.
    </p>

    <p>In the next lesson, we will take care of the two other criteria on the list - HTTPS and service worker.
