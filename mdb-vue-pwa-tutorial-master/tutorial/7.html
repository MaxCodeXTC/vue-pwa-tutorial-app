      <strong>Support for iOS devices</strong>
    </h2>

    <p class="description">
      The PWA concept in its current shape was propagated by Google, currently staying its biggest supporter, providing
      guidance in spec creation and overall promotion. Worth to note, though, is that the original technology of having
      webapps shortcuts was first presented by the very Steve Jobs back in 2007 (and it was called WebClip at the time).
      It did not gain much traction then and the tech got pretty much abandoned for over 10 years. Apple silently got
      back to play in March 2018 with iOS 11.3, adding support for the PWA basics - Web Manifest and Service Worker. You
      can now leverage caching with service workers and make your PWA work without an internet connection on iOS
      devices, too! It's not all roses, though.</p>

    <p>
      When it comes to Worker, you can only persist app data and cache files, but no background tasks. There is also a
      50MB and “few weeks” limit for storage. Manifest's icons are not working perfectly (or at all) and there’s no
      support for launch screens - you’ll get only a blank white screen when the app is loading. The app is reloaded
      each time it is brought back from the background, and there's no support for push notifications and many other
      functionalities which are essential for a mobile app - no support for Bluetooth Low Enegy devices, WebShare,
      Speech Recognition and most notably - the Web App Banner. But we will make it through - together - and try to do
      what we can to provide for the PWA experience. We will achieve it by adding iOS specific tags in our template.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lack of support for some of the manifest's functionalities means we need to emulate them somehow - usually, by
      adding special tags to our <code>./index.html</code>.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-5"><strong>Shortcut Icon</strong> </h4>

    <p class="description">
      Firstly, like with Windows or Android platforms, there is a baseline set of icons to cover the iOS. These are all
      square, with dimensions of <code>120x120</code>, <code>152x152</code>, <code>167x167</code> and
      <code>180x180</code> pixels. The best option is to prepare your set of icons for different platforms and different
      sizes all together, and online generators usually cover you in that. Moreover, while installing your app, iOS does
      not use the icons from the manifest file - but we can get around that, by adding special tags:</p>

    <mdbsnippet>
      <code data-lang="js" data-name="./index.html">
        <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="static/icons/Icon-120.png">
        <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="152x152" href="static/icons/Icon-152.png">
        <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="167x167" href="static/icons/Icon-167.png">
        <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="static/icons/Icon-180.png">
      </code>
    </mdbsnippet>

    <h4 class="mt-5"><strong>Adding a Launch Icon Title</strong> </h4>

    <p class="description">
      To define an app title - similar to the name and short name properties defined in the <code>manifest.json</code>
      file, let's add an <code>apple-mobile-web-app-title</code> element:
    </p>

    <mdbsnippet>
      <code data-lang="js" data-name="public/index.html">
        <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-title" content="Agenda App">
      </code>
    </mdbsnippet>

    <p>Now, when the user click 'add to the homescreen" button, he will see popup as shown below:</p>

    <div class="text-center"> <img class="img-fluid"
        src="https://mdbootstrap.com/wp-content/themes/mdbootstrap4/content/vue/tutorials/vue-pwa/7/iOsbanner.png"
        alt="Copy HTML"></div>


    <h4 class="mt-5"><strong>Standalone mode</strong> </h4>

    <p class="description">
      To mimic the standalone look of the native application we have to tell the browser, that we want to launch our
      project as a web app. We also want to hide a status bar, by default black, that is visible
      across the top of the screen. We can achieve this by adding these two lines:
    </p>

    <mdbsnippet>
      <code data-lang="js" data-name="public/index.html">
        <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
        <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="black-translucent">
      </code>
    </mdbsnippet>

    <h4 class="mt-5"><strong>Splash Screen</strong> </h4>

    <p class="description">
      The last thing we have to take care of is a launch screen - right now, iOS doesn't generate splash screens from
      the manifest.json - as it works in Android. Instead, we have to provide an image for each Apple device screen;
      what's more, we also need to inline CSS breakpoints and the <code>orientation</code> attribute into our html - not
      only for each said device, but for both its <code>landscape</code> and <code>portrait</code> orientations.

      Phew, that's around 20 tags depending on the field of device coverage you're planning. I advise to use an online
      tool for splash images creation, as it can be really tiresome manually. <a href="TODO">Here, have these icons
        here!</a> Unpack in the <code>/static</code> directory.
    </p>

    <p>In the end our <code>./index.html</code> file will look like this:</p>

    <mdbsnippet>
      <code data-lang="html" data-name="public/index.html">
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
