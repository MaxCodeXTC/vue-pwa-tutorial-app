      <strong>The App Shell Model</strong>
    </h2>

    <p class="description">
      Our app looks great, but there is always room for improvement. If we want to compete with native apps, we have to
      work on our app <strong>load time</strong>.</p>

    <p>If you test your website on a fast internet connection, you may have not noticed the blank screen - but it is there, even more so when user with a lousy signal downloads our monolithic JavaScript file.</p>

    <p>It's because of how modern single page apps work - at the first load, we serve the <code>index.html</code> file,
      which for now is just a blank page with <code>div#app</code>. Next, the JS bundle is downloaded and then it has to
      boot up our Vue application. This approach lets us make our website dynamic, immersive and interactive, but the
      downside is that it significantly increases load time.</p>

    <p>As developers, it is our duty to consider every user, who may live in the areas where the network speed is
      not so impressive. We want to ensure that all users have the best possible experience.</p>

    <p>In today's lesson, I want to introduce you to the concept of the App Shell.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-5"><strong>The App Shell</strong></h4>

    <p>The Application Shell architecture is a concept of separating the content of your app from the UI shared across
      different views. In other words - the app shell is a part of the app which does not change often. We want the
      minimum HTML and CSS to display something meaningful to the user as soon as possible. The first load should be
      extremely quick and then get immediately cashed. The JS bundle is always too big, as well - let's reduce it.</p>

    <p>1. Let's remove our stylesheets import in the <code>src/main.js</code> file and replace them with link tags in
      the root folder's <code>index.html</code>'s head tag. We are doing it so that the critical resources can be
      fetched quick, along the initial markup and without waiting for our heavy-weight JS.</p>

    <mdbsnippet>
      <code data-lang="js" data-name="./index.html">
        <!-- Bootstrap core CSS -->
        <link href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/4.2.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"
          rel="stylesheet">
        <!-- Material Design Bootstrap -->
        <link href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mdbootstrap/4.7.1/css/mdb.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
      </code>
    </mdbsnippet>

    <section>
      <blockquote class="blockquote bq-warning my-2">
        <p class="bq-title">Note!</p>
        <p>Since we will be <code>linking</code> to the stylesheets directly in our <code>index.html</code>, there is no
          need for mentioning <code>bootstrap</code>'s CSS for the second time, as a dependency in our
          <code>package.json</code>. Feel free to delete it from there. Remember to <code>yarn</code> the project if you do.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </section>

    <p>2. Using browser dev tools, copy the HTML code of our app. Paste it inside <code>div#app</code> in the root
      directory's <code>index.html</code>.</p>

    <div class="text-center"> <img class="img-fluid"
        src="https://mdbootstrap.com/wp-content/themes/mdbootstrap4/content/vue/tutorials/vue-pwa/6/copy.png"
        alt="Copy HTML"></div>

    <p>The markup copied that way will have Vue-specific hash-named attributes starting with <code>data-v-{hash}</code>.
      Their purpose has to do internal workings of the framework - they are used to seamlessly identify DOM elements.
      You don't have to worry about them being there, feel free to keep them or delete. The easiest way is to find all
      places a particular attribute appears is either by using a search tool or, in newer versions of VSCode, by
      selecting one and keep on pressing <code>Ctrl + D</code> to select the others, then <code>Del / Backspace</code>.
      To skip this manual labour have a look below, where a markup that has already been tidied up is presented.</p>

    <p>See the class-less, id-less div beneath the <code>Today:</code> header? These are our events - live, dynamic,
      fetched from a server, cache or <code>localStorage</code>. Right now we are working on the static HTML, one to be
      displayed before anything else happens - it has no idea about events to display, as it did not have a chance to
      ask the backend about them yet. This is why, instead of pretending we know stuff we really don't, let's give our
      users an indication of progress during the initial app load. Delete these pesky events' markup in their
      class-less, id-less tags and paste the code for a Bootstrap loader instead.</p>

    <mdbsnippet>
      <code data-lang="js" data-name="markup">
        <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
          <div class="spinner-border" style="width: 3rem; height: 3rem;" role="status">
            <span class="sr-only">Loading...</span>
          </div>
        </div>
      </code>
    </mdbsnippet>

    <p>Way better. Now refresh the page - for a brief moment, you should see our app with a loader. When the JavaScript
      finishes downloading and the initialisation process kicks in, Vue will generate content to replace whatever is
      happening in the <code>div#app</code> element.</p>

    <p>Right, now a complete <code>./index.html</code> code should look something like this:</p>

    <mdbsnippet>
      <code data-lang="html" data-name="./index.html">
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>

        <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0">
          <title>mdbvue</title>
          <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js" async></script>
          <link rel="manifest" href="/static/manifest.json" />
          <!-- Bootstrap core CSS -->

            rel="stylesheet">

          <link href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mdbootstrap/4.7.1/css/mdb.min.css" rel="stylesheet">

    <p>And this is how we let our users know stuff is happening in the background! Deploy this new, sweet feature using
      <code>yarn deploy</code>.</p>
